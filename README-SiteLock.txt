- You must authorize your server IP in RWI before you begin. To do this visit RWI, login, scroll to the bottom, click the link  "Add IPs for script/API access" and put your IP in the address field. Note that it may take up to 1 hr for this to propagate.

**If you want to test these modules on our test server, it will require that you generate a separate API key from the test interface.

OpenSRS SiteLock Module:
####################################

To setup OpenSRS SiteLock, add a new product and configure the 'modules settings' tab:

Username: <opensrs username>
API Key: <your opensrs API key>
Type: Basic, Premium or Enterprise

SiteLock requires a custom field called "Domain" to properly process orders.

To manage existing SiteLock purchases you need to:
1. Create an order from the WHMCS admin panel
2. Set created product to active and do not send invoice confirmations
3. Set the domain and product length details to match your previous purchase in RWI and submit order
4. When product is active you should see a field called "Order ID" under the customers Product/Services tab
5. Visit the RWI and find the SiteLock product you want to setup. Look for the Order ID field and copy that # into the WHMCS Order ID and press save changes
6. Click on save. If you see "Service Details" than everything should working fine.

*Please ensure that both domain fields match what is in the RWI, the Product/Service type must be the same (ie. basic, premium, enterprise) and set the expiry date manually to sync with RWI expiry date
